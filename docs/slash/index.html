        <p>Slash is the software that runs sites like Slashdot and use.perl.
It’s all written in Perl using the Template Toolkit with MySQL at the
back end. Despite it being based on a number of my favourite
technologies, I’d never really the time to get to know how it worked.
Reviewing this book finally gave me the excuse to spend a few hours
looking at it. I decided the best way to “test” the book would to be to
try and set up and configure a Slash web site whilst reading the
book.</p>
<p>The book starts by giving an overview of Slashdot - the site that the
Slash code grew out of. This is followed by an overview of how a Slash
site looks to the user and a brief look at the architecture of Slash.
All very interesting, but it didn’t get me any closer to setting up my
Slash site.</p>
<p>That started in chapter 2, which is a guide to installing Slash.
During this chapter I became aware that the book (or, at least, this
part of it) wasn’t really aimed at me. By this I mean that the chapter
assumed that the reader knows less than I do about installing Perl
modules, setting up MySQL databases and configuring Apache. I was fast
coming to the conclusion the the book’s target audience was people who
wanted to run a weblog using Slash, but didn’t really know very much
about Apache, MySQL or Perl. This made reading this chapter very quick
and in an hour or so I had a basic Slash site up and running.</p>
<p>The next five chapters look at the nuts and bolts of running a Slash
site. They describes the processes of setting up authors, editing and
updating stories, reviewing and approving submissions, dealing with
comments and managing topics and sections. Again, I read all of this
pretty quickly as the chapters were going over in some detail processes
that I was finding pretty easy to work out from the layout of the Slash
administration pages. One section stood out. In the middle of chapter 6
there is a discussion on how Perls’s regular expressions can be used to
filter comments. I found myself wondering how easily my assumed target
audience would deal with this material.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 changes direction completely. This chapter discusses ways
to manage the community that builds up around a successful Slash site.
It was almost completely non-technical but, building on their ideas of
what has made Slashdot so successful the authors present some
interesting ideas on the nature of web communities. To me, this chapter
alone justifies reading the book.</p>
<p>In chapter 9 we’re back with customising your site, with sections on
setting up Slashboxes (little areas of content that go down the side of
a Slash site), exhanging headlines with other sites using XML and
managing user polls. Again there’s not much comlpex technical content in
this chapter.</p>
<p>In the last two chapters we suddenly get <em>very</em> technical,
looking at advanced site customisation and administration issues. In
particular, when the advanced customisation chapter looks at plugins, it
gives an example of how to write a plugin and this may well all be a bit
confusing for the target audience I discussed earlier. This is aimed at
someone who knows what they are doing when it comes to Perl and
MySQL.</p>
<p>The five appendices act as a reference to the Slash codebase. They
contain much in depth information about the database tables and the API
exposed by the various Slash modules. Appendix C contains a useful
introduction to the Template Toolkit, which Slash uses to create all of
the actual HTML pages. There’s a <em>lot</em> of information in this
pages and they take up about a third of the book.</p>
<p>I suspect I’ve come across a little more negative that I intended in
this review. I do think it’s a very useful book and should be read by
anyone running (or thinking of running) a site using Slash. My only
problem is that is seems to be two half books joined together. The
second half seems to be aimed at a far more technically literate
audience than the first half.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that I got my Slash site up and running and I
know a lot more than I did about how to configure and administer it - so
the book does what I wanted it to.</p>
