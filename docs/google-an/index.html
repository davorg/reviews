        <p>I run a number of web sites and I’ve been running Google Analytics on
many of them for several months, but ever since I started using it, I’ve
been sure that I could probably get a lot more useful information out of
Analytics than I am currently doing. Currently I’m only looking at a
handful of the huge number of available reports. So when I was offered
the chance to review this book, I hoped that it would really open my
eyes to the power of Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Reading the book has largely met those goals for me. I now make far
better use of Google Analytics. But getting that information out of the
book hasn’t been a particulary enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that part (if not most) of the problem is that I’m
not in the audience that the authors had in mind when they were writing
the book. I’m an IT consultant who has been building web sites for over
ten years. I’ve been monitoring web site usage using systems like
Webaliser and AWStats for a lot of that time and I’ve picked up quite a
bit of knowledge of web site measurement technology over the years. So
when the “Who Should Read This Book” section of the introduction says
“Do you have a web site or blog that you’d like to track? Can you
control the HTML on that site? If that’s you, you’ve got the right book”
then I think that I’m the kind of person that the book is written for.
Unfortunately, what that section doesn’t say is that if you already have
reasonable level of knowledge about how this all works, then you’re
probably going to find a lot of the book a bit tedious and pointless.
The book seems to actually be aimed that the large number of people who
have a web site but aren’t web industry professionals. I can’t complain
about that really. That’s obviously a much larger market, but I wish
that the book’s marketing made that a bit clearer. A lot of this books
reads like<em>Google Analytics for Dummies</em> and that’s not the book
that I was looking for.</p>
<p>That’s not, of course, to say that it’s a bad book. Just that I think
its marketing might be mistargetted.</p>
<p>Having mentally reclassified the book as a “for dummies” book I had
to try hard to recalibrate my expectations of the book and ignore the
classic “for dummies” style of the book. For example the whole book is
written in a very “folksy” voice that I find irritating and completely
inappropriate for technical books.</p>
<p>The authors also seem to be under the impression that some of the
material that they cover will be too hard for their readers. For
example, when talking about regular expressions they say “Regex can be
pretty confusing, even for experienced users”. As a trainer and writer,
I know that if you tell someone that a concept is really confusing then
you can almost guarantee that they will be confused by it. As a teacher
it’s your job to make sure that the concepts aren’t confusing. Regular
expressions <strong>are</strong> complex, but they follow regular rules
(the clue there is in the name) and you really shouldn’t need to teach
them using an attitude which discourages people from trying to
understand them.</p>
<p>But actually I suspect that the reason the authors take this approach
with regular expressions is that they themselves don’t really understand
them. I think this because their examples are all a bit confused and not
very well explained at all. For example they have an example which uses
the regular expression <code>690=([^&amp;amp;]*)</code>and nowhere do
they take the time to explain what it means or how it works. After
reading this section, I’d be surprised if anyone comes out with a
clearer understanding of regular expressions than when they went in.</p>
<p>However, the section on regular expressions is by far the most
technical part of the book and in the rest of it the authors are on far
more solid ground. When explaining all of the reports that you can get
from Google Analytics then their explanations get much clearer. This is
where the value of the book is to be found. Google Analytics has dozens
of reports and the authors clearly understand the data that they all
contain and what each report can be used to show about your web site
visitors. I found a number of useful reports that I hadn’t previously
been using and that are now giving me far better information about who
is visiting my sites.</p>
<p>In summary, the descriptions of the Google Analytics reports are very
useful if you can ignore the over-familiar language, but the sections
that contain deep techical detail are patchy at best.</p>
