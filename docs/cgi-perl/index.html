<p>There are a very large number of Perl CGI books in the shops.
Unfortunately the number of <em>good</em> Perl CGI books is far smaller.
I’m happy to report that this book is one of them.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, with most Perl CGI books is that they are
written by people who just don’t know very much Perl. That’s certainly
not the case here. Both Kevin and Brent are well-respected members of
the Perl community and they know what they are talking about when it
comes to writing CGI programs in Perl.</p>
<p>Another common mistake in Perl CGI books is that the authors try to
take people who know a bit of HTML and teach them programming, Perl and
CGI all at the same time. The authors of this book realise that this
approach is likely to lead to, at best, patchy understanding of any of
these concepts so they aim there book at people who are already
programmers and who have some knowledge of Perl. This means that they
can concentrate of teaching the parts of Perl that are useful when
writing CGI programs.</p>
<p>One corner that is often cut when discussing CGI programming is
security. This is a very dangerous approach to take as a badly written
CGI program can leave your web server open to attack from anyone on the
Internet. That’s not a mistake that is made here as the authors
introduce security in chapter 2. Add to that the fact that the code
examples all use <code>-w</code>, <code>use strict</code> and
<code>CGI.pm</code> and the book is already head and shoulders above
most of its competition.</p>
<p>Early chapters look at common CGI requirements such as file uploads
and cookies. Each chapter is full of well written (and well-explained)
sample code. The example of an access counter in chapter 6 even locks
the file containing the current count - this is possibly a first in a
Perl CGI book!</p>
<p>By the middle of the book we have already moved beyond simple CGI
programming and are looking at mod_perl. This chapter covers both the
“faux-CGI” Apache::Registry module and also writing complete mod_perl
handlers.</p>
<p>In the second half of the book we start to look at some bigger
examples. The authors present a web-based email system and even a
shopping cart. In order to fit these examples into their respective
chapters a couple of corners have been cut, but there’s enough
information there to enable anyone to write the complete systems.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 introduces the HTML::Mason module as a way to separate
content from presentation. It’s obvious that the author’s are big fans
of this module and this leads to my only real criticism of the book. At
no point do they mention the fact that the same benefits can be gained
from using any of half a dozen templating systems found on the CPAN. I
would have been a lot happier if they had mentioned things like
Text::Template, HTML::Template and the Template Toolkit before picking
HTML::Mason as the system for their example.</p>
<p>There are then two more long chapters with examples of a document
management system and image manipulation software. Once more the code in
these examples would serve as a greating starting point for anyone
wanting to implement something along these lines. The last chapter looks
at XML and, in particular, the use of RSS files to provide data feeds to
other web sites.</p>
<p>All in all this is a very useful book for someone wanting to write
web-based applications using Perl. It’s packed full of good advice and
code that follows all of the best practices for writing CGI programs in
Perl. This book won’t teach you Perl, but if you’ve read <em>Learning
Perl</em> or <em>Elements of Programming with Perl</em> then you’ll find
this book easy enough to follow.</p>
