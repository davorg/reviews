        <p>One of Perl’s great strengths is in processing text files. That is,
after all, why it became so popular for generating dynamic web pages -
web pages are just text (albeit text that is supposed to follow
particular rules). As XML is just another text format, it follows that
Perl will be just as good at processing XML documents. It’s therefore
surprising that using Perl for XML processing hasn’t recieved much
attention until recently. That’s not saying that there hasn’t been work
going on in that area - many of the Perl XML processing modules have
long and honourable histories - it’d just that the world outside of the
Perl community doesn’t seem to have taken much notice of this work. This
is all set to change with the publication of this book and O’Reilly’s
<em>Perl and XML</em>.</p>
<p><em>XML and Perl</em> is written by two well-known members of the
Perl XML community. Both are frequent contributors to the “perl-xml”
mailing list, so there’s certainly no doubt that they know what they are
talking about. Which is always a good thing in a technical book.</p>
<p>The book is made up of five sections. The first section has a couple
of chapters which introduce you to the concepts voered in the book.
Chapter one introduces you separately to XML and Perl and then chapter
two takes a first look at how you can use Perl to process XML. This
chapter finishes with two example programs for parsing simple XML
documents.</p>
<p>Section two goes into a lot more detail about parsing XML documents
with Perl. Chapter three looks at event-driven parsing using XML::Parser
and XML::Parser::PerlSAX to demonstrate to build example programs before
going to talk in some detail about XML::SAX which is currently the state
of the art in event-driven XML parsing in Perl. It also looks at
XML::Xerces which is a Perl inteface to the Apache Software Foundation’s
Xerces parser. Chapter four covers tree based XML parsing and presents
examples using XML::Simple, XML::Twig, XML::DOM and XML::LibXML. In both
of these chapters the pros and cons of each of the modules are discussed
in detail so that you can easily decide which solution to use in any
given situation.</p>
<p>Section three covers generating XML documents. In chapter five we
look at generating XML from text sources using simple <code>print</code>
statements and also the modules XML::Writer and XML::Handler::YAWriter.
Chapter six looks at taking data from a database and turning that into
XML using modules like XML::Generator::DBI and XML::DBMS. Chapter seven
looks at miscellaneous other input formats and contains examples using
XML::SAXDriver::CSV and XML::SAXDriver::Excel.</p>
<p>Section four covers more advanced topics. Chapter eight is about XML
transformations and filtering. This chapter covers using XSLT to
transform XML documents. It covers the modules XML::LibXSLT,
XML::Sabletron and XML::XPath.</p>
<p>Chapter nine goes into detail about Matt Sergeant’s AxKit, the Apache
XML Kit which allows you to create a website in XML and automatically
deliver it to your visitors in the correct format.</p>
<p>Chapter rounds off the book with a look at using Perl to create web
services. It looks at the two most common modules for creating web
services in Perl - XML::RPC and SOAP::Lite.</p>
<p>Finally, section five contains the appendices which provide more
background on the introductions to XML and Perl from chapter one.</p>
<p>There was one small point that I found a little annoying when reading
the book. Each example was accompanied with a sample of the XML
documents to be processed together with both a DTD and an XML Schema
definition for the document. This seemed to me to be overkill. Did we
really need both DTDs and XML Schemas for every example. I would have
found it less distracting if one (or even both) of these had been moved
to an appendix.</p>
<p>That small complaint aside, I found it a useful and interesting book.
It will be very useful to Perl programmers (like myself) who will
increasingly be expected to process (and provide) data in XML
formats.</p>
