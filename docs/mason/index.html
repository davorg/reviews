<p>If you’re building dynamic web sites, then sooner or later you are
going to come to the conclusion that your life will be much easier if
you use some kind of templating system. A templating system prevents you
from having the same pieces of HTML appearing in multiple places on your
web site as each page is generated from a template which defines the
parts of the page which are the same (site navigation, headers and
footers, stuff like that) leaving you free to worry about the actual
content which changes from page to page.</p>
<p>Mason is one such templating system that is available for use in
Perl. There are a number of such systems but Mason is certainly one of
the most popular and this book goes a long way towards explaining why.
It’s written by two of the core Mason development team and, as such, it
covers the use of Mason in great detail.</p>
<p>The book starts with a look at the features that Mason gives you and
a brief look at the major competitors to Mason. Whilst this is useful,
I’m not sure that it gave me enough information to decide to use Mason
instead of an alternative system. The authors assume that you don’t need
any coaching in Perl, so the don’t waste any time explaining anything
other than the Mason features that they are using.</p>
<p>Whilst it’s possible to use Mason on a site that is created with CGI
scripts, this can be a bit slow so most of the book is focussed on using
Mason under mod_perl - the Apache module which embeds a Perl compiler in
your web server.</p>
<p>One particularly useful chapter is the one which gives an extended
case study of how the authors used Mason to build a new web site from
scratch. This chapter contains valuable examples of the stages you can
go through when building a site using Mason. Another standout section is
the chapter on scalable design.</p>
<p>Although the book starts right from the basics of Mason usage, it
won’t stop being useful once you’ve mastered that. There are sections on
very advanced Mason features like overriding the parser that extracts
Mason commands from your source files and subclassing the various
objects that make up Mason.</p>
<p>If you’re looking at using a templating system on your web site then
Mason is certainly one that you should consider. And if you are using
(or planning to use) Mason, then this book looks like it will be
essential reading.</p>
