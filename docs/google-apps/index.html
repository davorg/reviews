        <p>I should confess that this book wasn’t what I thought it was. I was
interested in reading it because I misread the title. I thought it was
about the Google App Engine - which is a technology that I really want
to spend some time investigating. But it wasn’t about the Google App
engine, it was about Google Apps - the set of online applications that
Google have been introducing over the last few years.</p>
<p>That misunderstanding meant that I had to adjust my expectations of
the book somewhat. Instead of a book aimed at developers explaining the
inner detail of a technology, I got a book which was firmly aimed at end
users.</p>
<p>I don’t often read computer books aimed at end users. I find that I’m
not in the target audience. Unless an application is very complex then I
like to think that I can work out how to use it without resorting to
manuals. Of course that means that I often end up using only a small
fraction of the functionality of an application.</p>
<p>The Google application set is no exception to this rule. I’ve been
using many of the Google applications for some time. In particular I’ve
started to write a lot of documents and spreadsheets using Google Docs,
the online office suite which is intended as a replacement for Microsoft
Office. I tend to work on several different computers so having my
documents available on a web site means that the latest version is
available to me on any computer.</p>
<p>Google Docs is one of the most widely-used parts of the Google
application set and it’s a good place for this book to start. The first
four chapters present an over view of the applications and then one
chapter each concentrating on documents, spreadsheets and presentations.
As expected I found that I already knew most of what was described in
the early parts of the chapters, but I found myself saying “oh, that’s
useful” quite a lot towards the ends of the chapters as I read about
features that I hadn’t come across before. For example, I had no idea
that the spreadsheet application was able to access data from external
web sites and extract information which can be used in your
calculations. I’m sure I’ll find that useful in the future.</p>
<p>The next chapter talks about what is probably the best-known Google
application - Gmail (or, as it’s known in the UK, GoogleMail). I have a
Gmail account, but currently I only use it for a couple of high-volume
mailing lists. I certainly learned a lot about Gmail and I’ll probably
start using it a bit more now. This chapter, however, demonstrated the
obvious problem about using a book to learn about this products -
improvements to the Google applications appear frequently and some of
the information in the book is already slightly out of date.</p>
<p>Subsequent chapters go into other parts of the Google application set
in a similar level of detail. Google Calendar, iGoogle (the customisable
Google homepage) and Google Reader all get a chapter to themselves. Then
we have a few chapters that cover multiple projects. There’s a chapter
on Picassa and YouTube, one on Google Maps, Google Earth and SketchUp
(the last of which I had never heard of) and one on Blogger. The final
chapter is about tracking the success of your sites using Google
Analytics. In just about every chapter I learned something that will be
useful to me.</p>
<p>All in all, I found this book well worth reading and I’d recommend it
to anyone who has an interest in making better use of the Google
applications. There are only two caveats that you should consider.
Firstly, there’s the fact that it’s a very wide-ranging book and I think
that few people would use all of the applications and therefore find all
of the chapters useful. Secondly, as I mentioned above, all of the
Google applications are being updated and improved at an incredible
rate, so this is definitely going to be a book with a rather short shelf
life.</p>
