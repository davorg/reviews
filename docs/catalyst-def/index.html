<p>Catalyst is one of the most interesting projects to come out of the
Perl community in the last few years. Originating as a fork of the
Maypole web framework, Catalyst has grown into the <em>de facto</em>
standard for building web applications using Perl. Its power and
flexibility make it a great choice for many web-based projects.</p>
<p>But often great power and flexibility goes hand in hand with
complexity. I’ve used Catalyst in simple ways on a couple of projects
but I had always suspected that I wasn’t getting everything that I could
out of the software. What I really needed was a good book that explained
the best way to get the most out of Catalyst. With this book I think
I’ve got what I was looking for. The book is written by two core members
of the Catalyst team. They obviously know exactly what they are talking
about and lead the reader confidently through the complexities of
Catalyst.</p>
<p>Catalyst, like other well-known web frameworks like Django or Ruby on
Rails, uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This book doesn’t
assume that you are already familiar with this pattern and chapter 1
explains the underlying concepts in some detail. It also takes time to
compare the Catalyst way of doing things with CGI applications and to
compare Catalyst itself with other Perl frameworks like CGI::Application
and Jifty.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 gets you started by discussing how to install Catalyst.
This can be difficult as Catalyst requires a large number of other Perl
libraries to be installed, and this section explains the easiest way to
do with by using Perl’s built-in features. This chapter also contains an
introduction to Object Oriented programming in Perl using Moose. This is
indicative of the authors’ dedication to promoting modern Perl best
practices and it’s a topic I shall return to later.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 moves on to writing a simple application in Catalyst. Once
again the authors’ interest in best practices is evident as the
application is not only written using Moose, but also has a
comprehensive test suite. The application built in this chapter is
pretty simple and some corners are cut in order to get something written
as quickly as possible. These shortcomings are addressed at some length
in chapter 4 where the application is rewritten in order to make it
easier to maintain and extend.</p>
<p>Having written an application using Catalyst’s built-in development
web server, you will next need to deploy it. Chapter 5 takes a detailed
look at your options for deploying Catalyst applications on a range of
popular web servers.</p>
<p>The next two chapters look at two important parts of the Catalyst
framework. Chapter 6 looks at database models, concentrating on the use
of DBIx::Class - the most popular database abstraction layer used with
Catalyst (and, indeed, with Perl itself). Chapter 7 looks at Catalyst’s
dispatch model - how a Catalyst application decides which of its method
need to be called to respond to a given request. In earlier chapters I
felt that some of the details of the dispatch model had been rather
skimmed over, but this chapter more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 looks at another vital part of modern web applications -
that of authentication and authorisation. Catalyst has a number of
plugins which makes these activities as easy as I have seen in any web
framework. Chapter 9 looks at web services - both how to consume
external services in your application and how to make a web service API
available to users of your application. The latter becomes ridiculously
easy with Catalyst.</p>
<p>If there is something that you don’t think that Catalyst can do for
you, then you’ll find Chapter 10 useful as it examines a number of ways
to extend Catalyst’s behaviour. There are already dozens of add-ons and
plugins available for Catalyst, but this chapter gives clear
instructions on how to add to this collection.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 is a useful cookbook of recipes that will help you be more
efficient in your use of Catalyst. Some of them solve common problems
that you’ll come across when writing applications but another, more
interesting, section talks about ways to just become a more efficient
developer. Many of these (for example, using Perl::Tidy and
Perl::Critic) are general development techniques that aren’t specific to
Catalyst. Finally, chapter 13 looks at Reaction, which is a higher level
framework which is based on Catalyst.</p>
<p>One of the problems with writing books about a project like Catalyst
is that in the early days of a project, things can change very quickly.
Sometimes so quickly that a book is out of date before it is published.
I think that Catalyst has now settled down from the intense development
cycles of the last few years, so this book will be relevant to Catalyst
users for quite some time.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that Catalyst will be a useful tool to add to my
collection and that this book will be very useful while I’m getting
myself up to speed with writing applications with Catalyst. It’s also
very likely to be useful as a reference long after I’m familiar with how
Catalyst works. If you’re looking at writing a web application and are
looking for a framework to use then this book should convince you to add
Catalyst to the list of possibilities that you consider.</p>
<p>If you’re a Catalyst user or a potential Catalyst user then you don’t
really need me to tell me that this book will be well worth buying. But
there’s another group of people who I would highly recommend this book
to - and that’s everyone who is currently programming in Perl, even if
you never go near web developement or Catalyst. The reason for this
seemingly bizarre recommendation is easy to explain. Perl has been
changing a lot over the last five years. The basic syntax remains
(mostly) the same, but a number of new tools have been introduced that
every Perl programmers should be looking at. Perl books don’t get
published as frequently as they used to and this is (as far as I know)
the only book which emphasises new Perl tools like Moose and
DBIx::Class. There is a whole new Perl movement out there called Modern
(or Enlightened) Perl and this book is the best introduction to this
movement currently in print.</p>
<p>The application development methods discussed by the authors of this
book are the ones which will define good Perl development practice in
the coming years. If you have any interest in how you should be
developing Perl applications then you should be buying this book.</p>
