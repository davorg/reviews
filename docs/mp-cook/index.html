        <p>Over the last few years <code>mod_perl</code> has become a serious
force in web development. If you’re building a web site to run on an
Apache server and you want to write the code in Perl, then you’re going
to want to install <code>mod_perl</code> on your server too as it’s the
best way to avoid many of the performance issues with traditional CGI.
It’s taken a while for publishers to wake up to the fact, however, and
there haven’t been many books in the shops. It looks like this will be
the year that this changes. A number of <code>mod_perl</code> books are
about to be published and this is the first.</p>
<p>This book uses the popular “cookbook” approach, where the content is
broken down into short “recipes” each of which addresses a specific
problem. There are almost two hundred of these recipes in the book
arranged into chapters which discuss particular areas of
<code>mod_perl</code> development. In my opinion the cookbook approach
works much better in some chapters than in others.</p>
<p>It’s the start of the book where the cookbook approach seems most
forced. In chapter 1 problems like “You want to compile and build
mod_perl from source on a Unix platform” provide slightly awkward
introductions to explainations about obtaining and installing
<code>mod_perl</code> on various platforms (kudos to the authors for
being up-to-date enough to include OS X in list list). All the
information you want is there however, so by the end of the chapter
you’ll have <code>mod_perl</code> up and running.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 looks at configuration options. It tell you how to get your
CGI programs running under <code>mod_perl</code> using the
Apache::Registry module which simulates a standard CGI environment so
that your CGI programs can run almost unchanged. This will give you an
immediate performance increase as you no longer have the performance hit
of starting up a Perl interpreter each time one of your CGI programs is
run. This chapter also addresses issues like caching database
connections and using <code>mod_perl</code> as a proxy server.</p>
<p>We then get to part II of the book. In this section we look at the
<code>mod_perl</code> API which gives us to the full functionality of
Apache. This allows us to write Perl code which is executed at any time
during any of the stages of Apache’s processing.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 introduces the Apache request object which is at the heart
of the API and discusses various ways to get useful information both out
of and back into the object. Chapter 4 serves a similar purpose for the
Apache server object which contains information about the web server and
its configuration.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the authors look at Uniform Resource Indentifiers (URIs)
and discuss many methods for processing them. Chapter 6 moves from the
logical world of URIs to the physical world of files. This chapter
starts by explaining the Apache::File module before looking at many ways
to handle files in <code>mod_perl</code>.</p>
<p>The previous few chapters have built up a useful toolkit of
techniques to use in a <code>mod_perl</code> environment, in chapters 7
and 8 we start to pull those techniques together and look in more detail
at creating handlers - which are the building blocks of
<code>mod_perl</code> applications. Chapter 7 deal with the creation of
handlers and chapter 8 looks at how you can interact with them to build
a complete application.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 is one of the most useful chapters in the book as it deals
with benchmarking and tuning <code>mod_perl</code> applications. It
serves as a useful guide to a number of techniques for squeezing the
last drops of performance out of your web site. Chapter 10 is a useful
introduction to using Object Oriented Perl to create your handlers.
Whilst the information is all good, this is, unfortunately, another
chapter where the cookbook format seems a little strained.</p>
<p>Part III of the book goes into great detail about the Apache
lifecycle. Each chapter looks at a small number of Apache’s processing
stages and suggests ways that handlers can be used during that stage.
This is the widest ranging part of the book and it’s full of example
code that really demonstrates the power of the Apache API. I’ll just
mention one particular chapter in this section. Chapter 15 talks about
the content generation phrase. This is the phase that creates the actual
content that goes back to the user’s browser and, as such, is the most
important phase of the whole transaction. I was particularly pleased to
see that the authors took up most of this chapter looking at methods
that separate the actual data from the presentation. They have at
recipes that look at all of the commonly used Perl templating systems
and a few more recipes cover the generation of output from XML.</p>
<p>Finally, two appendices give a brief reference to
<code>mod_perl</code> hooks, build flags and constants and a third gives
a good selection of pointers to further resources.</p>
<p>This is the book that <code>mod_perl</code> programmers have been
waiting for. The three authors are all well-known experts in the field
and it’s great that they have shared their knowledge through this book.
If you write <code>mod_perl</code> applications, then you really should
read this book.</p>
