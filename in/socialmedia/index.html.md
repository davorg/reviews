Social media marketing is big business. All of the social media web sites are
awash with companies trying to use them to sell their products and services.
In many cases these campaigns are ill-conceived and end up annoying more
people and driving them away from the company in question.

It's not that social media marketing is particularly difficult. It's just that
it's a new area and it's very easy to get something wrong and to end up doing
more harm than good. The users of social media services tend to be a little
more clued-up than the general population and they are often suspicious of
traditional marketing methods. I'm sure we can all recite horror stories of
internet marketing campaigns that have backfired badly.

Dan Zarrella knows what he's talking about though. He knows how to tiptoe
around the minefield that is social media marketing without stepping on any
of the minds. If all of the people currently trying to use Facebook and
Twitter as a marketing tool would stop and spend a couple of hours (yes, it's
a very short book) reading Zarrella's book then their campaigns would all be
of a higher quality and they'd have a lot more success.

Zarrella covers all the bases in his discussion of social media tools. He goes
from blogging and Twitter to video sharing and Second Life. On the way he
shares all the nuances that he has picked up whilst working with these various
tools. Each chapter discusses a particular area in some depth and the final
two chapters step back from the detail to have a look at strategy and
measurement.

The precise sites that we'll be using in the future will no doubt change. It's
quite likely that won't still be using Twitter in three years time, but
Zarrella's advice is likely to still hold true as the underlying principles
will still be appropriate.

If you're planning a social media marketing campaign then it'll be well worth
your while reading this book.
