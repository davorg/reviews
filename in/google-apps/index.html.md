I should confess that this book wasn't what I thought it was. I was
interested in reading it because I misread the title. I thought it was
about the Google App Engine - which is a technology that I really want
to spend some time investigating. But it wasn't about the Google App
engine, it was about Google Apps - the set of online applications that
Google have been introducing over the last few years.

That misunderstanding meant that I had to adjust my expectations of the book
somewhat. Instead of a book aimed at developers explaining the inner
detail of a technology, I got a book which was firmly aimed at end
users.

I don't often read computer books aimed at end users. I
find that I'm not in the target audience. Unless an application is very
complex then I like to think that I can work out how to use it without
resorting to manuals. Of course that means that I often end up using
only a small fraction of the functionality of an application.

The Google application set is no exception to this rule. I've been using
many of the Google applications for some time. In particular I've
started to write a lot of documents and spreadsheets using Google Docs,
the online office suite which is intended as a replacement for
Microsoft Office. I tend to work on several different computers so
having my documents available on a web site means that the latest
version is available to me on any computer.

Google Docs is one of
the most widely-used parts of the Google application set and it's a
good place for this book to start. The first four chapters present an
over view of the applications and then one chapter each concentrating
on documents, spreadsheets and presentations. As expected I found that
I already knew most of what was described in the early parts of the
chapters, but I found myself saying "oh, that's useful" quite a lot
towards the ends of the chapters as I read about features that I hadn't
come across before. For example, I had no idea that the spreadsheet
application was able to access data from external web sites and extract
information which can be used in your calculations. I'm sure I'll find
that useful in the future.

The next chapter talks about what is
probably the best-known Google application - Gmail (or, as it's known
in the UK, GoogleMail). I have a Gmail account, but currently I only
use it for a couple of high-volume mailing lists. I certainly learned a
lot about Gmail and I'll probably start using it a bit more now. This
chapter, however, demonstrated the obvious problem about using a book
to learn about this products - improvements to the Google applications
appear frequently and some of the information in the book is already
slightly out of date.

Subsequent chapters go into other parts of
the Google application set in a similar level of detail. Google
Calendar, iGoogle (the customisable Google homepage) and Google Reader
all get a chapter to themselves. Then we have a few chapters that cover
multiple projects. There's a chapter on Picassa and YouTube, one on
Google Maps, Google Earth and SketchUp (the last of which I had never
heard of) and one on Blogger. The final chapter is about tracking the
success of your sites using Google Analytics. In just about every
chapter I learned something that will be useful to me.

All in all, I found this book well worth reading and I'd recommend it to
anyone who has an interest in making better use of the Google
applications. There are only two caveats that you should consider.
Firstly, there's the fact that it's a very wide-ranging book and I
think that few people would use all of the applications and therefore
find all of the chapters useful. Secondly, as I mentioned above, all of
the Google applications are being updated and improved at an incredible
rate, so this is definitely going to be a book with a rather short
shelf life.
