As a Perl programmer, my first instinct when given some XML to process
is to grab the appropriate Perl module (probably XML::XPath or XML::LibXML)
and use that to do whatever I need to. Although that usually gets the job
done, reading this book opened my eyes to a number of other XML processing
tools that will sometimes be more useful than a Perl program. Actually
Perl doesn't get mentioned at all in the index, whereas Java gets half a
column of entries.

A lot of the book isn't aimed at the kind of person who is comfortable
firing up an editor writing a program. Many of the hacks introduce
ready-made applications that handle a number of different XML tasks. For
example there are applications that, given an XML document, will take a
first pass at creating an XML Schema or DTD for the document. This is
something that would be an interesting project to write for yourself, but
if you just need the schema it's nice to know that someone else has already
written the application for you.

One of the most interesting chapters for me was the one about editing
XML. My usual tool for that is xml-mode in Xemacs but the book introduced
me to a number of other possibilities. The one that particularly
caught my eye was nXML for Emacs. Unfortunately it's not currently
compatible with Xemacs, so I need to try out some of the other editors
that are discussed.

Like all of O'Reilly's Hacks books, this book is aimed at a very wide
audience. Some of the tools are Open Source and some of them are
commercial. Some of them run on only one platform and some of them will
run anywhere. That has the potential to be a little frustrating when you
find a tool that looks really useful, only to find out that it only runs
on Windows. Fortunately the authors are aware of this problem and make a
real effort to present tools that run on as wide a range of platforms as
possible. If one hack presents a tool that only runs on Windows then you
can be sure that the next hack has a similar tool that runs somewhere else.

The audience is diverse along other dimensions too. There are hacks aimed
at people who will just want to save a Word document in DocBook format
(hint: use OpenOffice) and at the other end of the spectrum there are hacks
aimed at people who want to create SOAP services. There are hacks aimed
at all levels of producing and using XML.

It's an inevitable consequence of this type of book that not everyone
is going to find all of it useful. But the authors are obviously experts
in their field and they explain themselves very clearly. I thought I knew
a lot about processing XML but I discovered a lot of new and interesting
things from this book. If you want a good overview of the various ways that
XML can be useful to you, then this book would be a very good start.
