Mark Pilgrim has written a really useful introduction to the new technologies
that are driving HTML5 adoption. If you're creating HTML for web sites then I
recommend this book.

I'm not a web site designer, but I've always tried to produce web sites that
use valid HTML. And then when the current standard switched from HTML to XHTML
I converted most of my web sites to the new standard. A couple of years ago,
some friends started talking about HTML5 being a replacement for XHTML. I was
tired of converting my web sites, so I pretty much ignored them.

And then last year more and more people started talking about HTML5. It was
obviously time to investigate further. And Mark Pilgrim's book seemed as good
a place as any to start.

It turns out that HTML5 is rather more than just a mark-up language. It's a
term that encompasses a number of new technology standards that will be
driving web application development for many years to come.

Pilgrim explains all the new elements that are available in HTML5. Some of
these, obviously, won't be supported by older browsers so, perhaps more
importantly, he also covers how to detect which features are supported on a
browser which is visiting your site. In each case, he explains the nuts and
bolts of how it would be done, but then he also describes how it can be done
far more easily using the [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) Javascript
library.

The most interesting new features to me are the native support for audio and
video (although there is still some disagreement between browser makers as to
which formats are supported) and the canvas element which will finally allow
some powerful graphical effects to be produced in a manner which will work
well across most (if not all) browsers.

I haven't yet had a chance to really start using HTML5 on my web sites. But
when I do, this is a book that I will return to frequently.
