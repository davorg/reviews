A quote on the front cover of this book says "if you code in Perl
then you need to read this book". That's a pretty bold claim to make. It
made me think of the hyperbole on covers of books that claim to teach
you to program in Perl in just a few days. But this book is published by
Addison Wesley, who are a well respected technical publisher of technical
books and the quote is from Adam Turoff who certainly knows what he's
talking about when it comes to Perl programming. So in this case the
claim *isn't* hyperbole. The book really is one that I want every
Perl programmer to read.

Perl gets a lot of bad press from people who claim that it 
encourages people to write unreadable code. Whilst there's certainly
a lot of very bad Perl code out there I think that's more a sign that
it's used by a lot of people who don't know how to program than a 
reflection on the language itself. And that's where this book comes
in. It assumes that you are familiar with the syntax of Perl but that
you've never really been shown how to use it effectively. Which is a
situation that many Perl programmers find themselves in.

*Perl Medic* is actually targetted at people who have to
maintain older Perl code written by someone else, but I think that the
information it contains is just as useful to anyone coding in Perl.
Peter Scott has a lot of experience in writing Perl and in training
other people to write Perl and the distillation of that experience and
knowledge into these 300-odd pages mean that there are few Perl
programmers who won't pick up something useful from this book.

The main emphasis in the book is on increasing the maintainability
of code. The techniques are wide-ranging. I particularly enjoyed the
examples of refactoring programs and the coverage of using modules from
CPAN. Two other very good sections are the one on antipatterns in chapter
4 and the one on cargo cult programming in chapter 6. Together these
sections give a programmer a number of easy to recognise quick wins
when improving existing code and a checklist of things not to do when
writing new code.

There are a couple of niggles. I've already mentioned that I
think the book has been slightly mis-targetted and that it should
have been aimed at anyone writing Perl code. The other problem that I
had was that the medic analogy that runs through the book gets a bit
strained at times. But these are only minor and they shouldn't prevent
you from adding this book to your library.

In fact, all in all, the quote on the front cover is pretty
accurate.
