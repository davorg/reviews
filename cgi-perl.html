    <p>There are a very large number of Perl CGI books in the shops. 
      Unfortunately the number of <i>good</i> Perl CGI books is far smaller. 
      I'm happy to report that this book is one of them.</p><p>The problem, of course, with most Perl CGI books is that they are 
      written by people who just don't know very much Perl. That's certainly 
      not the case here. Both Kevin and Brent are well-respected members of 
      the Perl community and they know what they are talking about when it 
      comes to writing CGI programs in Perl.</p><p>Another common mistake in Perl CGI books is that the authors try to 
      take people who know a bit of HTML and teach them programming, Perl and 
      CGI all at the same time. The authors of this book realise that this 
      approach is likely to lead to, at best, patchy understanding of any of 
      these concepts so they aim there book at people who are already 
      programmers and who have some knowledge of Perl. This means that they 
      can concentrate of teaching the parts of Perl that are useful when 
      writing CGI programs.</p><p>One corner that is often cut when discussing CGI programming is 
      security. This is a very dangerous approach to take as a badly written 
      CGI program can leave your web server open to attack from anyone on the 
      Internet. That's not a mistake that is made here as the authors 
      introduce security in chapter 2. Add to that the fact that the code 
      examples all use <code>-w</code>, <code>use strict</code> and 
      <code>CGI.pm</code> and the book is already head and shoulders above 
      most of its competition.</p><p>Early chapters look at common CGI requirements such as file uploads and 
      cookies. Each chapter is full of well written (and well-explained) sample
      code. The example of an access counter in chapter 6 even locks the file
      containing the current count - this is possibly a first in a Perl CGI 
      book!</p><p>By the middle of the book we have already moved beyond simple CGI
      programming and are looking at mod_perl. This chapter covers both the
      "faux-CGI" Apache::Registry module and also writing complete mod_perl
      handlers.</p><p>In the second half of the book we start to look at some bigger examples.
      The authors present a web-based email system and even a shopping cart. 
      In order to fit these examples into their respective chapters a couple 
      of corners have been cut, but there's enough information there to enable
      anyone to write the complete systems.</p><p>Chapter 13 introduces the HTML::Mason module as a way to separate 
      content from presentation. It's obvious that the author's are big fans 
      of this module and this leads to my only real criticism of the book. At 
      no point do they mention the fact that the same benefits can be gained 
      from using any of half a dozen templating systems found on the CPAN. I 
      would have been a lot happier if they had mentioned things like 
      Text::Template, HTML::Template and the Template Toolkit before picking 
      HTML::Mason as the system for their example.</p><p>There are then two more long chapters with examples of a document 
      management system and image manipulation software. Once more the code in
      these examples would serve as a greating starting point for anyone 
      wanting to implement something along these lines. The last chapter looks 
      at XML and, in particular, the use of RSS files to provide data feeds to 
      other web sites.</p><p>All in all this is a very useful book for someone wanting to write 
      web-based applications using Perl. It's packed full of good advice and 
      code that follows all of the best practices for writing CGI programs in 
      Perl. This book won't teach you Perl, but if you've read <i>Learning 
      Perl</i> or <i>Elements of Programming with Perl</i> then you'll find 
      this book easy enough to follow.</p>
