# Some book reviews

I wrote these book reviews between 2001 and 2012. Back in the days when publishers
were keep to produce overpriced and always slightly out of date technical books that
they could sell to people in the industry for about Â£40 each.

I do think there's a nice bit of nostalgia in reading these old reviews - but, mostly,
this has been a bit of a test for [Aphra](https://aphra.perlhacks.com/).
